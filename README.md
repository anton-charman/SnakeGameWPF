# Snake in WPF

## A simple version of the game Snake implemented in WPF and C#. Download the code now and have a play!

This project is an implementation of Snake using a WPF front-end and C# code-behind. 

✔ Use the arrow keys to move the snake up, down, left and right.

✔ Eat apples to grow the snake.

❌ Avoid the walls and your own tail.

## An example of what you will see...

Upon loading up the game you are greeted with the home screen:

Here's an in-game screenshot (can you beat my score?...):

## Installation instructions
Download the code from GitHub here, build it and enjoy the game.

## Issues and improvements
Here's a selection of items that I intend to implement next:
* Refactor the codebase into MVVM.
* Give the snake a snake-looking head that changes orientation with the snake motion.
* Make the apple actual apple pixel art and not just a red circle.
* Increase the granularity of the tiles to make motion smoother.
* Give users WPF controls to configure the game parameters (dimensions, colours and speeds).

Do get in contact if you have feature requests or suggested improvements. Have a great day :)
